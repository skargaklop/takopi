# Switch engines

Run a one-off message on a specific engine, or set a persistent default for a chat/topic.

## Use an engine for one message

Prefix the first non-empty line with an engine directive:

```
/codex hard reset the timeline
/claude shrink and store artifacts forever
/opencode hide their paper until they reply
/pi render a diorama of this timeline
/omp continue the Oh My Pi session
```

Directives are only parsed at the start of the first non-empty line.

## Set a default engine for the current scope

Use `/agent`:

```
/agent
/agent set claude
/agent clear
```

- Inside a forum topic, `/agent set` affects that topic.
- In normal chats, it affects the whole chat.
- In group chats, only admins can change defaults.

Selection precedence (highest to lowest): resume token -> `/<engine-id>` directive -> topic default -> chat default -> project default -> global default.

## Engine installation

Takopi shells out to engine CLIs. Install them and make sure they're on your `PATH`
(`codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, `pi`, `omp`). Authentication is handled by each CLI.

Oh My Pi is exposed as the `omp` engine and Takopi launches the terminal command
directly:

- runtime shells out to `omp`
- install/update with `bun install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`
- resume from Telegram with `` `omp --resume <token>` `` or `/omp resume <token>`
